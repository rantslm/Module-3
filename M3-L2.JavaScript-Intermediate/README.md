# M3-L2.JavaScript-Intermediate

## Module 3 Lab 2: Intermediate JavaScript

Welcome to the Intermediate JavaScript Lab\! Your goal is to complete the 10 functions in the `lab.js` file to solve a variety of challenges.

This lab is set up with an autograding test file. As you complete each function, you can run the tests locally to check your work before submitting.

-----

## Submission Instructions

Follow these steps to complete and submit your work.

1.  **Create a `dev` Branch:** Open your terminal in the project folder and run `git checkout -b dev` to create and switch to a new branch for your work.
2.  **Complete the Lab:** Edit the `lab.js` file to complete all the functions as described below.
3.  **Test Your Work:** Run `npm test` in your terminal to see which exercises are passing and which need more work.
4.  **Add and Commit:** When you are ready, stage and commit your changes with the commands `git add .` and `git commit -m "Complete lab 2 exercises"`.
5.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your work to your remote repository with `git push -u origin dev`.
6.  **Open a Pull Request:** On your GitHub repository page, open a pull request to merge your `dev` branch into your `main` branch.

## Lab Exercises

### **1. Capitalize Words**

Complete the function `capitalizeWords(str)` to take a string and return it with the first letter of each word capitalized.

### **2. Truncate String**

Complete the function `truncate(str, maxLength)` to cut off a string at `maxLength` and append an ellipsis (`...`) if it's too long. You must use a **ternary operator** for this task.

### **3. Array Manipulation**

The `arrayManipulation()` function takes a starting array. You must perform a series of manipulations—adding items to the beginning and end, sorting it, and replacing the middle element—before returning the final, modified array.

### **4. Camel Case Conversion**

Complete `camelCase(cssProp)` to convert a dash-separated string like `'margin-left'` into a camel-cased string like `'marginLeft'`.

### **5. Floating-Point Precision**

JavaScript's handling of decimal math can lead to small errors. Complete the function `currencyOperation(float1, float2, operation, numDecimals)` to safely perform basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on decimal numbers, returning a result rounded to the specified number of decimal places.

### **6. Find Unique Values**

Complete the function `unique(duplicatesArray)` to take an array that contains duplicate values and return a new array containing only the unique values.

### **7. Advanced Array Methods**

The `processBooks(books)` function takes an array of book objects. You must use the `map`, `filter`, and `find` methods to perform a series of data transformations and return an object containing the results.

### **8. The `Map` Object**

Complete the function `managePhoneBook(phoneBookABC, phoneBookDEF, newCarolineNumber)` to work with JavaScript `Map` objects. It should combine two phone books, update a contact, and return a map of all unique contacts.

### **9. Working with Object Data**

The `processSalaries(salaries)` function takes an object where keys are names and values are salaries. It should return an object containing the total of all salaries and the name of the highest earner.

### **10. The `Date` Object**

Complete the `processDate(date)` function to perform several calculations based on a given `Date` object, such as finding the total minutes passed in the day and calculating the days between two dates.
