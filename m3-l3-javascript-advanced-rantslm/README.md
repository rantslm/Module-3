# M3-L3.JavaScript-Advanced

## Module 3 Lab 3: Advanced JavaScript

Welcome to the Advanced JavaScript Lab\! This lab will test your understanding of complex concepts like closures, asynchronous programming, prototypes, and classes. Your goal is to complete the functions in the `lab.js` file.

This lab is set up with an autograding test file. As you complete each function, you can run the tests locally to check your work.

### Submission Instructions

1.  **Create a `dev` Branch:** Run `git checkout -b dev` to create and switch to a new branch for your work.
2.  **Complete the Lab:** Edit the `lab.js` file to complete all the functions as described below.
3.  **Test Your Work:** Run `npm test` in your terminal to see which exercises are passing.
4.  **Add and Commit:** Stage and commit your changes with `git add .` and `git commit -m "Complete advanced JS lab"`.
5.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your work to your remote repository with `git push -u origin dev`.
6.  **Open a Pull Request:** On your GitHub repository page, open a pull request to merge your `dev` branch into your `main` branch.

## Lab Exercises

### **1. Closures: `makeCounter`**

Complete the `makeCounter(startFrom, incrementBy)` function. It should return a new function that acts as a counter. Each time the returned function is called, it should increment its internal count by `incrementBy` and return the new value. Each counter created must be independent.

### **2. Asynchronous JS: `delayMsg`**

Complete the `delayMsg(msg)` function. This function will be called by `setTimeout`. You must also determine the correct order in which the messages will print and return that order as an array of strings from the `getOrder()` function.

### **3. Asynchronous JS: `debounce`**

Complete the `debounce(func, ms)` decorator function. It should take a function and a delay in milliseconds. The returned function, when called, should only execute the original `func` after `ms` milliseconds of inactivity. If it's called again within the delay period, the timer should reset.

### **4. Asynchronous JS: `printFibonacci`**

Complete the `printFibonacci(limit)` function. It should use `setInterval` to print the next number in the Fibonacci sequence every second, stopping after it has printed `limit` numbers.

### **5. `this` Keyword: `car`**

The `car` object's `description` method fails when called from `setTimeout`. Complete the `fixCar()` function to create a new version of the method, `boundDescription`, that is permanently bound to the `car` object and will work correctly inside `setTimeout`.

### **6. Prototypes: `delay`**

Add a `delay(ms)` method to the `Function.prototype`. This new method should return a delayed version of the original function that will execute after `ms` milliseconds. The delayed function must be able to accept any number of arguments.

### **7. Classes and Inheritance: `PrecisionClock` & `AlarmClock`**

Extend the `DigitalClock` class.

- Create a `PrecisionClock` that inherits from `DigitalClock` and accepts a `precision` parameter (the tick interval in ms).
- Create an `AlarmClock` that inherits from `DigitalClock` and accepts a `wakeupTime` (e.g., `'08:30'`). It should stop ticking and log "Wake Up\!" when the current time matches the wakeup time.

### **8. Decorator Functions: `validateStringArgs`**

Complete the `validateStringArgs(fn)` decorator. It should take a function `fn` and return a new function that checks if all of its arguments are strings. If any argument is not a string, it should throw a `TypeError`.

### **9. Promises: `randomDelay`**

Complete the `randomDelay()` function. It must return a promise that resolves or rejects after a random delay between 1 and 10 seconds. The promise should **resolve** if the random delay is an **even** number and **reject** if it is an **odd** number.

### **10. `async/await`: `fetchURLDataAsync`**

Rewrite the promise-based `fetchURLData` function using `async/await` syntax. Your new function, `fetchURLDataAsync`, should perform the same task: fetch data from a URL, check for a successful HTTP status, and return the JSON data.
